osu!dreamer is a generative model for osu! beatmaps based on diffusion

## Quick start

[colab notebook (no installation required)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Th6v5OOrY5vcTWvIH3NKZsuj_RMnAEM5#sandboxMode=true)

## Installation for development

### Required dependencies
- FFmpeg
- python 3.9
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) 

Clone this repo, then run:

```
poetry install [--with dev]
```

This will install `osu-dreamer`'s dependencies

## Generate your own maps locally

```
$ poetry run python -m osu_dreamer.model predict --help
Usage: python -m osu_dreamer.model predict [OPTIONS]

  generate osu!std maps from raw audio

Options:
  --model_path FILE       trained model (.ckpt)
  --audio_file FILE       audio file to map
  --sample-steps INTEGER  number of diffusion steps to sample
  --num_samples INTEGER   number of maps to generate
  --title TEXT            Song title - required if it cannot be determined
                          from the audio metadata
  --artist TEXT           Song artist - required if it cannot be determined
                          from the audio metadata
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```

## Model training

### Generate dataset

first you must generate a dataset, using eg. your `osu!/Songs` directory.
This step only needs to be done once (unless you delete the generated dataset directory).

```
$ poetry run python -m osu_dreamer.model generate-data [MAPS_DIR]
```

where `[MAPS_DIR]` is the path to eg. your `osu!/Songs` directory

### Training

after the dataset generation completes, you can start training

```
$ poetry run python -m osu_dreamer.model fit
```

See `osu_dreamer/model/model.yml` for all training parameters.

At the end of every epoch, the model parameters will be checkpointed to `lightning_logs/version_{NUM}/checkpoints/epoch={EPOCH}-step={STEP}.ckpt`. You can resume training from a saved checkpoint by adding `--ckpt-path [PATH TO CHECKPOINT]` to the `fit` command.

run `tensorboard --logdir=lightning_logs/` in a new window to track training progress in Tensorboard

### visual validation

The training process will generate one plot at the end of every epoch, using a sample from the validation set

-   the first row is the spectrogram of the audio file
-   the second row is the actual map associated with the audio file in its signal representation
-   the third and fourth rows are signal representations of the maps produced by the model

## üíª Windows Batch Setup

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Support for training/evaluating the model locally on Windows is highly experimental and provided as-is

### Requirements
-   üêç Python 3.9 (via Microsoft Store, or python.org)

### Installation

Install the source code directly through github, or with the git clone command:

`git clone https://github.com/jaswon/osu-dreamer`

### Usage

Setup from this point is pretty simple, navigate into the osu-dreamer directory and then into the `windows_scripts` folder, this is where all the batch scripts are stored.

First, you will need to run `! Install.bat`, this will install osu-dreamer and all of its dependencies. Optionally you can install tensorboard and mathplotlib to view training statistics.

Now you're ready to begin training your own model! Here is a list of all the scripts and their functionality

-   Install
    -   Installs osu-dreamer and all of its dependencies.
-   Run Training
    -   Compiles the given songs directory and begins training a model
-   Resume Training
    -   Resumes training the given checkpoint
-   Generate Beatmap
    -   Generates a beatmap with the given information (requires a trained model and song)
-   Tensorboard
    -   Hosts tensorboard for tracking training statistics
